RulesToSuppress:
  - id: W89
    reason: Always ignore lambda must be inside VPC, because I don't need/use a VPC
  - id: W58
    reason: Always ignore 'Lambda functions require permission to write CloudWatch Logs', because that is handled by a cdk custom resource
  - id: W92
    reason: Always ignore 'Lambda functions should define ReservedConcurrentExecutions to reserve simultaneous executions', because I can't control the reserved concurrency of cdk custom resource lambdas
